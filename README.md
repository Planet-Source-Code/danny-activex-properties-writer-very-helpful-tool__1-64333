### Description

This is a tool I originally made for myself but I thought others might find it useful. If you write a lot of ActiveX controls, you probably spend a lot of time typing the code for properties. Well, now you don't have to, because this will generate all of the code for you, including: Property Container variable declarations, property get, set/let routines, UserControl_InitProperties(), UserControl_ReadProperties(), and UserControl_WriteProperties() events. I added in a few options in a Preferences form, like custom code indentation, commenting, etc. In the next version I plan to add a bunch more features, if you have an idea for one let me know. Please leave a comment if you find this useful. :) Also: Please read the help.htm file, it explains everything. You can load the file from the folder, or goto the Help -&gt; Help Contents menu from the program.
